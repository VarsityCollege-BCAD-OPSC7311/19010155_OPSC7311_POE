This repository contains the updated app I created for this assignment. It is called: JADWAT HEALTH

For the final submission, upon the features that were mentioned in the previous task, we are to implement an additional feature: "The app must display current levels as well as targets for height, weight and caloric intake in a visual format (e.g. pie or bar chart)".
The only flaw with this feature requirement, is that there is no possible reason to have "height" amongst the levels that need to be displayed as this is unrelated.

There are 9 features in total to implement. I have unfortunately only managed to implement 8 of those 9 features. The one missing/bugged features are the capturing pictures of the user's meals for the day as this proved difficult to implement and troubleshoot. I apologise for this.

When running the app, the first screen that will greet you is the MainActivity which I made the Login screen. Which will then lead to the screen where the user will enter all the required information. After, the user will see the main screen that has a BottomNavigationView with buttons that lead to indicated fragments.

On the Home screen, the user will be see a circle progress chart that will display the progress of their daily calorie intake.
On the Current Levels screen, the user will see the current and target levels for height and calorie intake in a Bar Chart format.
On the Weight Progress screen, the user will be able to see a log of their daily weight changes which will show what date it was recorded. 
On the Settings screen, the user can edit certain information, as well as be able to logout.

Please register for an account so that your details can be added to the database to make for easy testing when continously running the app.

NB. I have added the account and password (respectively) for basic testing the firebase database: admin@password.com, password
