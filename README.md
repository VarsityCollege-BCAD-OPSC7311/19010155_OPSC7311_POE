This repository contains the prototype app I created for this assignment. It is called: JADWAT HEALTH

In the assignment, we are given the instructions to add the following features: A user must be able to login to the app using a user name and password. A user must be able to store their physiological information, i.e. their height and weight. A user must be able to change their settings from using the metric system (e.g. kilograms and meters) to using the imperial system (e.g. pounds and inches) A user must be able to set target goals for weight and calorie intake A user must be able to keep a log of their daily weight changes A user must be able to capture a daily photograph of their meals for that day The user must be able to view and edit profile information

Those are 8 features listed. I have unfortunately only managed to implement 6 of those 8 features. The two missing/bugged features are the capturing pictures of the user's meals for the day, and the user being able to keep a log of their weight changes. I apologise for this.

When running the app, the first screen that will greet you is the MainActivity which I made the Login screen. Which will then lead to the screen where the user will enter all the required information. After, the user will see the main screen that has BottomNavigationView with buttons that lead to indicated fragments.

On the main screen, the user will be see a circle progress chart that will display the progress of their daily calorie intake. On the settings screen, the user can edit their information, as well as be able to logout.

Please register for an account so that your details can be added to the database to make for easy testing when continously running the app.

NB. I have added the account and password for when I tested the firebase database: admin@password.com, password
